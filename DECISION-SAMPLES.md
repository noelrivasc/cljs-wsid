# Sample decisions to test WSID:

## RELOCATE TO COASTAL TOWN OR STAY?
I've been offered a remote-friendly apartment in a coastal town three hours from where I currently live. I love the idea of morning walks on the beach, a slower pace of life, and lower rent — but my entire social circle, my favorite coffee shop, my climbing gym, and my aging parents are all rooted in my current city. I've lived here for over a decade and have built something real, even if the grey winters and crowded streets have started to wear on me. The coastal town feels like a dream, but I can't shake the fear that I'd be trading a full life for a pretty view.

## KIDS OR NO KIDS?
My partner and I have been going back and forth on this for years now. There's a part of me that feels a deep pull toward parenthood — the idea of raising someone, watching them grow, building a family that extends beyond just the two of us. But I also love my life as it is: the freedom, the spontaneity, the sleep. I worry that I'd resent the loss of myself, and equally that I'd regret never having tried. Everyone around me seems to have made their peace with whichever choice they made, and I can't figure out if that's reassuring or terrifying.

## MUSIC OR LAW?
I've spent the last few months paralyzed between two paths that feel like entirely different lives. Music has been part of me since I was eight years old — it's the thing that makes me feel most alive, most like myself. But law offers something I can't ignore: stability, a clear career ladder, the ability to actually argue for things I believe in. I'm afraid that studying law means slowly watching that musical part of me shrink until it's just a hobby I rarely make time for. But I'm equally afraid that chasing music means years of uncertainty and ending up somewhere I never intended.
